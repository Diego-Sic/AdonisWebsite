                            One of the First challenges you will face in applying to the USA is the price.
                            I expend approximately 1,000 dollars if I sum up application fees, CSS profile, 
                            SAT, TOEFL, and translation of documents. Knowing that the minimum salary in Guatemala 
                            is less than 1,000 dollars, the most reasonable step is trying to get a sponsor or scholarship.
                            In my case, I got the scholarship provided by <a href="https://educationusa.state.gov/" target="_blank">Education USA</a> , which paid for all the application 
                            costs, visa, and flight ticket.

                        <div>
                            When I decided to apply, I spent around 20 hours per week working on my application, 
                            studying for the SAT and TOEFL, talking with my professor, and filling out my common app 
                            application. This is a big commitment because once you start, you have to make the maximum
                             effort to finish otherwise, all that time will be lost.

                            I start the application process six months before the deadline for the majority of the 
                            universities in the USA. The workload was immense due to the short amount of time.
                            If you're considering applying, I strongly recommend starting as soon as possible. 
                            I started in july of my senior year (5to bachillerato), and my recommendation is starting
                            at the beggining of junior year (4to bachillerato)

                            for scholarships and studying abroad. You will find resources that helped me in my process 
                            and a recopilation of advice I got during my experience.

                                <div>The SAT is a multiple-choice, pencil-and-paper test 
                                    created and administered by the College Board. It has 2 
                                    sections, and each of those sections is separated into other 2 sections. 
                                    4 in total. <span class="important">Math with calculator, Math without calculator,  Writing, 
                                    and Reading.</span> The most difficult for me, and the majority, is the Reading part
                                    because it has a dense vocabulary. <span class="important">The score of the test is over 1600,</span>vmajority of universities
                                    do not ask for a specific score, but the more the best!

                                <div>If you haven't studied English for so long, your best friend will 
                                    be the <span class="important">math and writing sections </span> 
                                    because they are the easiest to master. Personally, the majority of my mistakes 
                                    were in the reading section. <span class="important">Try to make no flaws in the

                                <div>Somehow or another, we have to improve in the <span class="important">reading section </span>. My main advice 
                                    for this is to read many books in English before taking
                                    the SAT. This will improve your ability to understand
                                    without understanding. This means getting the main ideas
                                    of a paragraph even if you don't get some of the words.</div>

                                <div>When you practice for the SAT, try to do it with 
                                    the real settings, the same duration
                                    the same break time, and in paper.
                                    This will help you to track your real progress
                                    and to manage your time.
